# The best thing that happened in 2024

As the year comes to an end we try I try to come to terms with how much I have achieved. Here are three tips I can tell you about reflecting on your year:

## 1. Celebrate small wins

Don't just focus on the big achievements. Sometimes the smallest progress can be the most meaningful.

## 2. Reflect honestly

Take time to honestly assess what worked and what didn't. This isn't about being harsh on yourself, but about learning.

## 3. Set intentions, not just goals

Think about how you want to feel in the coming year, not just what you want to accomplish.

The best thing that happened to me this year was learning to appreciate the journey, not just the destination. I've found that when I focus on being present and engaged in what I'm doing, rather than just rushing to the next goal, I actually achieve more and feel better about it.
