# How I pulled off a noise generator plugin

As the year comes to an end we try I try to come to terms with how much I have achieved. Here are three tips I can tell you about creating design plugins:

## Understanding WebAudio API

The Web Audio API was the foundation for this project. It provides a powerful and versatile system for controlling audio on the web, allowing for creating, processing, and analyzing audio.

## The Design Challenge

Creating a noise generator is not just about the audio - it's also about the interface. I wanted to make something that:

- Looked beautiful and minimal
- Was intuitive to use
- Provided visual feedback that matched the audio

## Implementation Details

I used a combination of different noise types:

1. **White noise**: Equal power across all frequencies
2. **Pink noise**: Power decreases as frequency increases
3. **Brown noise**: Power decreases more rapidly at higher frequencies

The most challenging part was creating an intuitive visualization that responded to the settings in real-time, giving users visual feedback that matched what they were hearing.

You can try out the plugin at [noisegen.design](https://noisegen.design) or check out the code on GitHub.
